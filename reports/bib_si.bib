abstract = {Secondary mass savings are mass reductions that may be achieved in supporting (load-bearing) vehicle parts when the gross vehicle mass (GVM) is reduced. Mass decompounding is the process by which it is possible to identify further reductions when secondary mass savings result in further reduction of GVM. Maximizing secondary mass savings (SMS) is a key tool for maximizing vehicle fuel economy. In today's industry, the most complex parts, which require significant design detail (and cost), are designed first and frozen while the rest of the development process progresses. This paper presents a tool for estimating SMS potential early in the design process and shows how use of the tool to set SMS targets early, before subsystems become locked in, maximizes mass savings. The potential for SMS in current passenger vehicles is estimated with an empirical model using engineering analysis of vehicle components to determine mass-dependency. Identified mass-dependent components are grouped into subsystems, and linear regression is performed on subsystem mass as a function of GVM. A Monte Carlo simulation is performed to determine the mean and 5th and 95th percentiles for the SMS potential per kilogram of primary mass saved. The model projects that the mean theoretical secondary mass savings potential is 0.95 kg for every 1 kg of primary mass saved, with the 5th percentile at 0.77 kg/kg when all components are available for redesign. The model was used to explore an alternative scenario where realistic manufacturing and design limitations were implemented. In this case study, four key subsystems (of 13 total) were locked-in and this reduced the SMS potential to a mean of 0.12 kg/kg with a 5th percentile of 0.1 kg/kg. Clearly, to maximize the impact of mass reduction, targets need to be established before subsystems become locked in.},

Copyright and Disclaimer notice on page 6 applies throughout. 1 Preamble Welcome to Bloomberg New Energy Finance's 2017 Long Term Electric Vehicle Outlook, our annual analysis of how EV adoption will impact automotive and energy markets. The outlook combines the expertise of our global Advanced Transport team and draws on dozens of pieces of research and data sets we published over the last year. It looks at how economics, technology, policy, and consumer behavior will impact EV adoption between now and 2040. The report analyses five underlying factors that we expect to drive increased EV adoption over the coming years: • Short-term regulatory support in key markets like the U.S., Europe and China • Falling lithium-ion battery prices • Increased EV commitments from automakers • Growing consumer acceptance, driven by competitively priced EVs across all vehicle classes • The growing role of car sharing, ride hailing and autonomous driving (termed 'intelligent mobility' here). In the outlook, we treat passenger EV adoption primarily as a consumer technology diffusion problem. Most of our long-term consumer uptake modelling is driven by economics – vehicle purchase prices and total cost of ownership – but we also take into account other country-specific vehicle market characteristics. We also look at the role that charging infrastructure and building stock will play in enabling or inhibiting the uptake of EVs in different countries. In this year's report, we integrate a new view of lithium-ion battery price declines, a more granular analysis of the impact of intelligent mobility, as well as a more nuanced short-term view (2017-21) of EV sales based on upcoming EV model releases in key markets. We also look closely at the relative economics of EVs against comparable internal combustion vehicles in four different vehicle segments. The report closes by looking at the impacts of EV adoption on electricity and oil demand, as well as demand for key materials like lithium, cobalt, graphite, nickel and manganese.},

abstract = {Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are hybrid electric vehicles that can be fueled from both conventional liquid fuels and grid electricity. To represent the total contribution of both of these fuels to the operation, energy use, and environmental impacts of PHEVs, researchers have developed the concept of the utility factor. As standardized in documents such as SAE J1711 and SAE J2841, the utility factor represents the proportion of vehicle distance travelled that can be allocated to a vehicle test condition so as to represent the real-world driving habits of a vehicle fleet. These standards must be used with care so that the results are understood within the context of the assumptions implicit in the standardized utility factors. This study analyzes and derives alternatives to the standard utility factors from the 2001 National Highway Transportation Survey, so as to understand the sensitivity of PHEV performance to assumptions regarding charging frequency, vehicle characteristics, driver characteristics, and means of defining the utility factor. Through analysis of these alternative utility factors, this study identifies areas where analysis, design, and policy development for PHEVs can be improved by alternative utility factor calculations. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Future Automotive Systems Technology Simulator (FASTSim) is a high-level advanced vehicle powertrain systems analysis tool supported by the U.S. Department of Energy's Vehicle Technologies Office. FASTSim provides a quick and simple approach to compare powertrains and estimate the impact of technology improvements on light- and heavy-duty vehicle efficiency, performance, cost, and battery life. The input data for most light-duty vehicles can be automatically imported. Those inputs can be modified to represent variations of the vehicle or powertrain. The vehicle and its components are then simulated through speed-versus-time drive cycles. At each time step, FASTSim accounts for drag, acceleration, ascent, rolling resistance, each powertrain component's efficiency and power limits, and regenerative braking. Conventional vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, all-electric vehicles, compressed natural gas vehicles, and fuel cell vehicles are included. Powertrains with electric-traction drive can optionally be simulated using electric roadway technologies such as dynamic wireless power transfer. FASTSim also has an interface for running large batches of real-world drive cycles. FASTSim's calculation framework and balance among detail, accuracy, and speed enable it to simulate thousands of driven miles in minutes. The key components and vehicle outputs have been validated by comparing the model outputs to test data for many different vehicles to provide confidence in the results. A graphical user interface makes FASTSim easy and efficient to use. FASTSim is freely available for download from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's website (see www.nrel.gov/fastsim).},

abstract = {Alternative transportation fuels and advanced vehicle technologies are being promoted to help reduce local air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and the United States dependence on imported oil. To more accurately and completely evaluate the energy and emissions effects of alternative fuels and vehicle technologies, researchers should consider emissions and energy use from vehicle operations, fuel production processes, and vehicle production processes. This research area is especially important for technologies that employ fuels and materials with distinctly different primary energy sources and production processes, i.e., those for which upstream emissions and energy use can be significantly different. The GREET (Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation) model was originally developed to evaluate fuel-cycle (or well-to-wheels) energy use and emissions of various transportation technologies (Wang 1999). In 2006, the GREET vehicle-cycle model was released to examine energy use and emissions of vehicle production and disposal processes (Burnham et al. 2006). This document updates the key vehicle specifications in Burnham et al. (2006) for the latest publically available version, GREET2{\_}2012, of the vehicle-cycle model. In addition to the parameters described in this document, GREET2{\_}2012 includes updated data on production and recycling of lithium-ion batteries, material production of several key vehicle materials, and part manufacturing and vehicle assembly (Dunn et al. 2012; Keoleian et al. 2012; Sullivan et al. 2010).},

Because light trucks are typically less fuel efficient than automobiles and because they have longer lifetimes, there is concern about the long run impact of this trend on the fuel efficiency of the light duty vehicle population. This paper investigates the scrappage patterns of imported and domestic automobiles and light duty trucks over the period 1966-1977. Estimated scrappage functions for the three vehicle types differ significantly, the most striking difference being the longer lifetimes of light trucks as compared to passenger cars (median lifetimes were 14.5 and 9.9 years respectively). A comparison of pre and post 1973 time periods does not alter this conclusion. The long run effect of this is likely to be a vehicle population share about 5 percentage points higher than the light truck market share of new vehicles and a 3{\%} reduction in overall fleet fuel economy. ?? 1981.},

abstract = {This study examines the vehicle-cycle and vehicle total life-cycle impacts of substituting lightweight materials into vehicles. We determine part-based greenhouse gas (GHG) emission ratios by collecting material substitution data and evaluating that alongside known mass-based GHG ratios (using and updating Argonne National Laboratory's GREET model) associated with material pair substitutions. Several vehicle parts are lightweighted via material substitution, using substitution ratios from a U.S. Department of Energy report, to determine GHG emissions. We then examine fuel-cycle GHG reductions from lightweighting. The fuel reduction value methodology is applied using FRV estimates of 0.15-0.25, and 0.25-0.5 L/(100km{\textperiodcentered}100 kg), with and without powertrain adjustments, respectively. GHG breakeven values are derived for both driving distance and material substitution ratio. While material substitution can reduce vehicle weight, it often increases vehicle-cycle GHGs. It is likely that replacing steel (the dominant vehicle material) with wrought aluminum, carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CRFP), or magnesium will increase vehicle-cycle GHGs. However, lifetime fuel economy benefits often outweigh the vehicle-cycle, resulting in a net total life-cycle GHG benefit. This is the case for steel replaced by wrought aluminum in all assumed cases, and for CFRP and magnesium except for high substitution ratio and low FRV.},

abstract = {Lightweighting is a key strategy used to improve vehicle fuel economy. Replacing conventional materials (e.g., steel) with lighter alternatives (e.g., aluminum, magnesium, and composites) decreases energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during vehicle use, but often increases energy consumption and GHG emissions during materials and vehicle production. Assessing the life-cycle benefits of mass reduction requires a quantitative description of the mass-induced fuel consumption during vehicle use. A new physics-based method for estimating mass-induced fuel consumption (MIF) is proposed. We illustrate the utility of this method by using publicly available data to calculate MIF values in the range of 0.2-0.5 L/(100 km 100 kg) based on 106 records of fuel economy tests by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for 2013 model year vehicles.

abstract = {Lightweighting is a key strategy to improve vehicle fuel economy. Assessing the life-cycle benefits of lightweighting requires a quantitative description of the use-phase fuel consumption reduction associated with mass reduction. We present novel methods of estimating mass-induced fuel consumption (MIF) and fuel reduction values (FRVs) from fuel economy and dynamometer test data in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) database. In the past, FRVs have been measured using experimental testing. We demonstrate that FRVs can be mathematically derived from coast down coefficients in the EPA vehicle test database avoiding additional testing. MIF and FRVs calculated for 83 different 2013 MY vehicles are in the ranges 0.22-0.43 and 0.15-0.26 L/(100 km 100 kg), respectively, and increase to 0.27-0.53 L/(100 km 100 kg) with powertrain resizing to retain equivalent vehicle performance. We show how use-phase fuel consumption can be estimated using MIF and FRVs in life cycle assessments (LCAs) of vehicle lightweighting from total vehicle and vehicle component perspectives with, and without, powertrain resizing. The mass-induced fuel consumption model is illustrated by estimating lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emission benefits from lightweighting a grille opening reinforcement component using magnesium or carbon fiber composite for 83 different vehicle models.},

abstract = {In this article we consider interactions between life cycle emissions and materials flows associated with lightweighting (LW) automobiles. Both aluminum and high-strength steel (HSS) lightweighting are considered, with LW ranging from 6{\%} to 23{\%} on the basis of literature references and input from industry experts. We compare the increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with producing lightweight vehicles with the saved emissions during vehicle use. This yields a calculation of how many years of vehicle use are required to offset the added GHG emissions from the production stage. Payback periods for HSS are shorter than for aluminum. Nevertheless, achieving significant LW with HSS comparable to aluminum-intensive vehicles requires not only material substitution but also the achievement of secondary LW by downsizing of other vehicle components in addition to the vehicle structure. GHG savings for aluminum LW varies strongly with location where the aluminum is produced and whether secondary aluminum can be utilized instead of primary. HSS is less sensitive to these parameters. In principle, payback times for vehicles lightweighted with aluminum can be shortened by closed-loop recycling of wrought aluminum (i.e., use of secondary wrought aluminum). Over a 15-year time horizon, however, it is unlikely that this could significantly reduce emissions from the automotive industry, given the challenges involved with enabling a closed-loop aluminum infrastructure without downcycling automotive body structures.},

abstract = {This work assesses the potential of electrified vehicles and mass reduction to reduce life cycle energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is used to account for processes upstream and downstream of the vehicle operation, thereby incorporating regional variation of energy and GHG emissions due to electricity production and distinct energy and GHG emissions due to conventional and lightweight materials. Design harmonization methods developed in previous work are applied to create baseline and lightweight vehicle models of an internal combustion vehicle (ICV), hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV). Thus, each vehicle is designed to be functionally equivalent and incorporate the structural support required for heavier powertrains. Lightweight vehicles are designed using body-in-white (BIW) mass reduction scenarios with aluminum and advanced/high strength steel (A/HSS). For the mass reduction scenarios considered in this work, results indicate that the greatest life cycle energy and GHG emissions reductions occur when steel is replaced by aluminum. However, since A/HSS requires less energy to produce as compared to aluminum, the energy and GHG reductions per unit mass removed is greatest for A/HSS. Results of the design harmonization modeling method show that 0.2-0.3. kg of structural support is required per unit increase in powertrain mass, thus extending previous methods. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {After a precipitous drop from 1976–1982, the weight of US passenger cars has grown steadily. This article examines multiple conflicting influences on vehicle weight in two categories: technological changes that reduce vehicle weight and improvements in functionality that, ceteris paribus, add to vehicle weight. The widespread adoption of unibody construction, lightweight materials and smaller engines has been offset by growth in vehicle size and feature content. The best estimates from this work indicate that new features and functionality would have added at least 250 kg (550 lbs) to the weight of the average new car between 1975 and 2009, if not for offsetting improvements in technology. Over the same period, it is estimated that alternative materials, more weight-efficient vehicle architectures and reduced engine sizes have taken 790 kg (1700 lbs) out of the weight of the average car. These observable influences do not explain the full extent of the drop and subsequent growth in weight, suggesting that substantial non-observed technological improvements were made from 1976–1982 and that unobserved improvements in areas such as crashworthiness and NVH have added substantially to vehicle weight in the past two decades.},

abstract = {Light-weighting of passenger cars using high-strength steel or aluminum is a common emissions mitigation strategy. We provide a first estimate of the global impact of light-weighting by material substitution on GHG emissions from passenger cars and the steel and aluminum industries until 2050. We develop a dynamic stock model of the global car fleet and combine it with a dynamic MFA of the associated steel, aluminum, and energy supply industries. We propose four scenarios for substitution of conventional steel with high-strength steel and aluminum at different rates over the period 2010-2050. We show that light-weighting of passenger cars can become a "gigaton solution": Between 2010 and 2050, persistent light-weighting of passenger cars can, under optimal conditions, lead to cumulative GHG emissions savings of 9-18 gigatons CO2-eq compared to development business-as-usual. Annual savings can be up to 1 gigaton per year. After 2030, enhanced material recycling can lead to further reductions: closed-loop metal recycling in the automotive sector may reduce cumulative emissions by another 4-6 gigatons CO2-eq. The effectiveness of emissions mitigation by material substitution significantly depends on how the recycling system evolves. At present, policies focusing on tailpipe emissions and life cycle assessments of individual cars do not consider this important effect.},

@techreport{EIA2017,
abstract = {EIA's Annual Energy Outlook provides modeled projections of domestic energy markets through 2050, and includes cases with different assumptions of macroeconomic growth, world oil prices, technological progress, and energy policies. With strong domestic production and relatively flat demand, the United States becomes a net energy exporter over the projection period in most cases. • Projections in the Annual Energy Outlook 2017 (AEO2017) are not predictions of what will happen, but rather modeled projections of what may happen given certain assumptions and methodologies. • The AEO is developed using the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS), an integrated model that aims to capture various interactions of economic changes and energy supply, demand, and prices. • Energy market projections are subject to much uncertainty, as many of the events that shape energy markets and future developments in technologies, demographics, and resources cannot be foreseen with certainty. • More information about the assumptions used in developing these projections is available shortly after the release of each AEO. • The AEO is published pursuant to the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977, which requires the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) Administrator to prepare annual reports on trends and projections for energy use and supply. • The Reference case projection assumes trend improvement in known technologies, along with a view of economic and demographic trends reflecting the current central views of leading economic forecasters and demographers. • It generally assumes that current laws and regulations affecting the energy sector, including sunset dates for laws that have them, are unchanged throughout the projection period. • The potential impacts of proposed legislation, regulations, or standards are not reflected in the Reference case. • EIA addresses the uncertainty inherent in energy projections by developing side cases with different assumptions of macroeconomic growth, world oil prices, technological progress, and energy policies. • Projections in the AEO should be interpreted with a clear understanding of the assumptions that inform them and the limitations inherent in any modeling effort. • Oil prices are driven by global market balances that are mainly influenced by factors external to the NEMS model. In the High Oil Price case, the price of Brent crude in 2016 dollars reaches {\$}226 per barrel (b) by 2040, compared to {\$}109/b in the Reference case and {\$}43/b in the Low Oil Price case. • In the High Oil and Gas Resource and Technology case, lower costs and higher resource availability than in the Reference case allow for higher production at lower prices. In the Low Oil and Gas Resource and Technology case, more pessimistic assumptions about resources and costs are applied.},

@article{Wadud2016,
abstract = {Experts predict that new automobiles will be capable of driving themselves under limited conditions within 5-10 years, and under most conditions within 10-20 years. Automation may affect road vehicle energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in a host of ways, positive and negative, by causing changes in travel demand, vehicle design, vehicle operating profiles, and choices of fuels. In this paper, we identify specific mechanisms through which automation may affect travel and energy demand and resulting GHG emissions and bring them together using a coherent energy decomposition framework. We review the literature for estimates of the energy impacts of each mechanism and, where the literature is lacking, develop our own estimates using engineering and economic analysis. We consider how widely applicable each mechanism is, and quantify the potential impact of each mechanism on a common basis: the percentage change it is expected to cause in total GHG emissions from light-duty or heavy-duty vehicles in the U.S. Our primary focus is travel related energy consumption and emissions, since potential lifecycle impacts are generally smaller in magnitude. We explore the net effects of automation on emissions through several illustrative scenarios, finding that automation might plausibly reduce road transport GHG emissions and energy use by nearly half - or nearly double them - depending on which effects come to dominate. We also find that many potential energy-reduction benefits may be realized through partial automation, while the major energy/emission downside risks appear more likely at full automation. We close by presenting some implications for policymakers and identifying priority areas for further research.},

@article{Ward2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, The Minerals, Metals {\&} Materials Society (outside the U.S.). Reducing vehicle weight is an important avenue to improve energy efficiency and decrease greenhouse gas emissions from our cars and trucks. Conventionally, models have estimated acceptable increased manufacturing cost as proportional to the lifetime fuel savings associated with reduced vehicle weight. Vehicle lightweighting also enables a decrease in powertrain size and significant reductions in powertrain cost. Accordingly, we propose and apply a method for calculating the maximum net benefits and breakeven cost of vehicle lightweighting that considers both efficiency and powertrain downsizing for a conventional internal combustion engine vehicle, a battery electric vehicle with a range of 300 miles (BEV300), and a fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV). We find that excluding powertrain downsizing cost savings undervalues the potential total net benefits of vehicle lightweighting, especially for the BEV300 and FCEV.},

abstract = {Displacement ratio of 1 happens only under a specific set of conditions. In reality, depending on these complex market effects, secondary products and materials may displace primary production of a different kind, or may simply lower overall prices, increase aggregate demand, and displace less material than is recycled, leading to incomplete displacement (Ekvall 2000). It has also been suggested that some secondary goods may actually be complements for primary goods (Thomas 2003). D = 1 happens either if primary producers are completely unresponsive to selling prices (possible for monoplies or in cases where production is intentionally decoupled from prices such as in the provision of public services, but not true for relatively competitive markets) or if the willingness or ability of buyers of primary material to switch to secondary material is virtually zero. D = 0 happens either completely fixed demand with zero response to price changes, or complete indifference between material types (in the case of downstream producers, it means that the marginal costs of substitution of primary buyers and secondary buyers are idential -- an unlikely scenario). Breakeven displacement rate for Al is 5{\%} to 10{\%} based on the relative carbon dioxide intensity of primary and secondary aluminum production. Can increase D by 1). improve the technical substitutability of secondary material 2). Improve sorting, cleaning, and preprocessing of collected materials 3). improve secondary material quality.},
